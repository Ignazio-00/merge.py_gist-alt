Conditional Trees that are to deep
* In "def status(...)" there are a lot of if else statements that make 
the function look more complicated than it should be

Seperation of Concerns
* A function should have only one functionality, and not do to many things,
"def close()" adds a vote and removes a vote and this can be broken up

Overuse of Strings
* Using strings to represent the status is suboptimal, when a string is mistyped then
a hard to debug error could occure

Code Duplication
* In "def close(...)" for example the status method is requested twice. A variable could be
used to prevent this
